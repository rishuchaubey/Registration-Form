This HTML code represents a simple, responsive Registration Form styled using Bootstrap 5.2.3. It includes various input fields to collect user data such as first name, last name, username, password (with a tooltip hint for password requirements), email, and resume upload. It also includes radio buttons for gender selection, checkboxes to choose skills, and a dropdown menu for selecting a city. The form has two buttons: one for submitting the form and another for resetting it. The layout is organized using Bootstrap's grid system, placing the form inside a column (col-6) within a row and a container to ensure proper spacing and alignment. Additionally, accessibility features like labels and required attributes enhance usability and form validation
